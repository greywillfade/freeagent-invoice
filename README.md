This is some sample code for use with FreeAgent custom invoice themes.

For more information on how to set up your custom invoice theme, please see: http://www.freeagent.com/support/kb/invoicing/css-guide-for-invoice-templates

This code is intended to be used as a theme with the FreeAgent DevKit. This is linked to in the above instructions, but you can also access it here: http://www.freeagent.com/support/kb/invoicing/invoice-devkit
My code will however run as a standalone, but you may want to get the original for reference.

Note that the HTML included in this package will not be used when you upload your theme. It is for local playing around only. The real HTML is all controlled by FreeAgent, so bear this in mind when doing your styles.

Bear in mind that any images referenced locally here will need to be absolute paths to something online instead when you add it to FreeAgent. In my CSS there is one file referenced in sj.css, line 37.
